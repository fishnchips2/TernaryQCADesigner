This project uses tiles to represent the ternary Quantum-dot Cells used in Quantum-dot Cellular automata.
The tiles have 3 main visual properties:

Orientation
- The orientation of the 2 small dots inside the tile represents the directional polarisation of a tQCA cell. Use CTRL+Left Click to permanently set the polarisation of a cell.
If the cell has no dots, its polarisation is unknown.

Shape
- The shape of the cell represents whether its polarisation is fixed. A square cell has fixed polarisation, a round cell can be influenced by its neighbours.
Use CTRL+Left CLick to fix a cell, or Left Click to make it mutable.

Colour
- The colour of the cell represents its clock phase. The software has 4 clock phases represented by red, green, blue and purple.
The cell will reset when its colour matches the colour of the tile in the top right corner. Use left click to change the clock phase of a cell.

The Simulate button steps the entire screen through one clock phase. The colour of the next phase is shown next to the button. This can be changed by Left Click,
and will also change the default colour of a new cell.

Use Right Click on a cell to bring up a window showing more information about the cell. The window contains a graph of that cell's polarisation during the previous clock step.
Clock steps are iterated 100 times to allow large networks of cells of the same phase to settle into a stable state.
